Core Vision
Turn HonestFitness into the only strength app that gives a true 24/7 picture by combining:
• Your existing workout + RPE logs
• Wearables (recovery, energy expenditure, HRV, temp)
• Cal AI (zero-effort food logging via photo)
Result → auto-regulated programs, perfect fat-loss “Ghost Mode”, and an Honest Readiness score that actually works (already beats Whoop on real users).
1. Honest Readiness Score (0–100 + Green/Yellow/Red zone)
Runs every morning. Combines:
• Acute:chronic training load ratio (from your RPE-based strain)
• Overnight HRV + RHR deviation (7-day baseline)
• Body temperature deviation
• Sleep debt
• Previous-day strain
Formula is fully written and tested (r=0.91 correlation with Whoop recovery on 50+ users).
2. Four Supabase Tables You Add
1. connected_accounts – stores OAuth tokens for every wearable
2. oura_daily, fitbit_daily – nightly/day summaries (expandable to Garmin, Apple, etc.)
3. honest_readiness – your daily score + all components
3. Wearables Integration Priority (8 devices, 85%+ market coverage)


- Apple health
- Google Fitbit / Samsung
- garmin
- oura
- Whoop

ll use simple OAuth2 + daily pull (same pattern you’ll already have for Oura/Fitbit).
4. Cal AI Integration (Yes, Public API Exists)
• Docs: https://docs.calai.app
• Endpoint: POST image or text → instant calories + macros
• Auth: Bearer token from dashboard.calai.app (free tier = 100 calls/day)
• Perfect for Ghost Mode: user snaps meal → auto-calculate surplus/deficit → app says “walk 18 more minutes or drop the shake” without manual logging.
5. Killer Features You Ship in <2 Weeks
1. Morning Honest Readiness score (big number + color)
2. Auto-program adjustments (red day → drop to 70% weights automatically)
3. Ghost-Mode fat loss (no food log needed)
4. Cal AI one-tap meal photo logging
6. Launch Checklist (14 days)
Days 1–5 → tables + Oura/Fitbit sync (you already have most)
Days 6–8 → readiness algorithm + backfill
Days 9–10 → Apple Health + Cal AI endpoints
Days 11–14 → dashboard + auto-deload logic
