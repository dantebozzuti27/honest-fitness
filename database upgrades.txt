Database Notes

Lets simplify the database without deleting any data
The connected accounts should currently only be
Fitbit
Oura
Apple watch
We need to standardize the inputted data from those 3 sources as they will impact our health metrics page 
Date
Resting heart rate
Hrv
Body temp
Sleep score
Sleep duration
Deep sleep
Rem sleep
Light sleep
Calories burned
Steps
Breathing rate
Spo2
Strain
If any of these metrics do not exist from one wearables source, it should come in as null to my database
If any of these are named differently across the 3 sources, they need to be normalized in my database
Health metrics should have some other columns that are only manually inputted by the user, these should be 
Weight
Body fat percentage
Age (determined by date of birth, prompt user during sign up)
Gender
Height (feet, inches)
These manual metrics can be optional for the user, and for trending purposes, they should be assumed as unchanged unless the user makes that changed 
For example, if a user logs their weight as 170, and then doesn’t log their weight for another week, the weight for the days in between should be assumed as 170
For workouts and exercises, we will log each workout down to the set, so that this can be organized easily, so far the structure seems to be doing that
For exercises, we need to expand our database to understand sub body parts, and the total body part
For example, squats are a leg exercise, but the sub body part would be glutes, quads, hamstrings, etc
When a user adds their own custom exercise, this should be written to the database as well
We need to differentiate weightlifting vs cardio, cardio should include distance
For nutrition, we need more detail as well, and common options
Categorizing, meat, dairy, grains, fruit, etc
Common foods and their calories and macronutrients
Ability for the user to save custom foods as well as favorites
User can choose recent foods as well
Does not need to normalize with the database as strictly as exercises and health metrics, as portion sizes can differ
CalAI add in (API to come later) must normalize with our calorie and macronutrient structure as data comes in
For goals, we need to match the structure of fitness, nutrition and health as we want to show them against the goals, and create a yes/no column on whether or not the user reached that daily goal (calorie intake), as well as making progress towards that goal (weight)
